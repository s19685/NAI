Despite Glasgow's economic renaissance, the East End of the city remains the focus of social deprivation.[34] A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widening.[35] In 2006, 47% of Glasgow's population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland,[35] while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city's working-age residents to be "economically inactive".[34] Although marginally behind the UK average, Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.[35]

In 2008 the city was ranked at 43 for Personal Safety in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world.[36] The Mercer report was specifically looking at Quality of Living, yet by 2011 within Glasgow, certain areas were (still) "failing to meet the Scottish Air Quality Objective levels for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10)"
